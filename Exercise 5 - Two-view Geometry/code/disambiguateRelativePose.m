% DISAMBIGUATERELATIVEPOSE- finds the correct relative camera pose (among
% four possible configurations) by returning the one that yields points
% lying in front of the image plane (with positive depth).
%
% Arguments:
%   Rots -  3x3x2: the two possible rotations returned by decomposeEssentialMatrix
%   u3   -  a 3x1 vector with the translation information returned by decomposeEssentialMatrix
%   p1   -  3xN homogeneous coordinates of point correspondences in image 1
%   p2   -  3xN homogeneous coordinates of point correspondences in image 2
%   K1   -  3x3 calibration matrix for camera 1
%   K2   -  3x3 calibration matrix for camera 2
%
% Returns:
%   R -  3x3 the correct rotation matrix
%   T -  3x1 the correct translation vector
%
%   where [R|t] = T_C2_W = T_C2_C1 is a transformation that maps points
%   from the world coordinate system (identical to the coordinate system of camera 1)
%   to camera 2.
